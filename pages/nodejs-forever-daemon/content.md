This is a development technote that explains how to setup [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) with a Node.js app so it runs like a daemon on Ubuntu Linux.  forever will automatically start the Node.js application when your Linux server starts and ensure it stays running. 


Node.js is built on Chrome's [V8 JavaScript Engine](http://code.google.com/p/V8).  It's useful for a range of applications and it brings JavaScript to the server.  Applications written in Node.js are event-driven.  For example, if you wanted to create a file, you would provide a callback function to be called upon the file's successful creation.  In this sort of model, your app doesn't become stuck waiting for events to finish executing.


## What you'll need

* [The Node.js runtime](http://nodejs.org)
* [The npm package manager](http://npmjs.org)


## Installing Node.js

I found it easiest to install Node.js from source.  Ubuntu's packaged version is very out-of-date, and the "node" program is renamed "nodejs."  This confuses many scripts that work with it, including forever.  Compilation is straightforward; after uncompressing and cd-ing into the source directory, follow the standard

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


## Installing forever 

forever, developed by nodejitsu, has functions to create applications that are always running&mdash;"forever" running.  If the application dies, forever brings it back.  It has built-in functionality to monitor processes.  It also offers an API you can use to incorporate its features into your own code. 

forever can be installed using npm.  npm should have been installed as part of Node.js: 

    sudo npm -g install forever


## Running a sample app 

Create the file test.js with the following contents:

    var http = require('http');

    http.createServer(function (request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.end('testing. . .\n');
    }).listen(8124);

    console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');

Then run:

    node test.js

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8124.  It should simply say "testing. . ."  Now you use forever to manage your application:

    forever start test.js

Note: If you installed forever as a normal user or in "local" mode (without the -g switch above), it may be located in your current working directory.  For example, if you installed from your home directory, it would be in ~/node_modules/.bin.  In this case, you'll have to run it like this for the rest of the tutorial:

    ~/node_modules/.bin/forever start test.js

You may also have problems later if you want to run forever at boot; if you do want to, be sure to install with -g as root.

forever should say something like:

    info:   Running action: start
    info:   Forever processing file: test.js

Stopping the app is similar:

    forever stop test.js

forever now says something like:

    info: Running action: stop
    info: Forever stopped process:
    data: uid  command script  forever pid  logfile uptime       
    [0] Bce7 node    test.js 33483   33484 /Users/marciogalli/.forever/Bce7.log 0:0:0:51.143 


## Note about logs and system messages

forever keeps logs, stdout and stderr messages in a file associated with your process.  Look for the hidden .forever directory in the home directory of the user you ran forever as. 


## Making your forever app launch at boot

If you've installed forever and Node.js system-wide (so that they are located somewhere in $PATH), you can have your app started by forever at system-boot using Ubuntu's upstart.  All you need to do is create a file named something like myapp.conf in /etc/init with the following contents:

    start on startup
    exec forever start /full/path/to/test.js
